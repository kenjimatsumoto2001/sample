Just click Radius+ to increase search area...\nStill using google search? Better use (twitter geo powered) search within!\nBTW, how about vine.co twitter videos from the place? Sure, click THE VINES to watch it playlisted...\nUnder tweets feel free to check what's top on Amazon by random category (at the moment from 10 available global locations)!\nJust under Random Pics spoiler are random space cats pics (for your pleasure).",

    "ArrayWorks has developed a new generation of software that is for enterprise class applications which is Built for Change. The software provides a radical new user experience by dynamically adapting the information being presented to the user in an integrated portal (InterTask). The applets in the portal can communicate with and include a broad range of information sources which exist\ninside or outside of the organization. The context intelligence of the portal also provides a predictive capability that determines if information needs to be presented to the user without the user explicitly asking for that data. This is an important departure from the state of current ERP which requires that information be explicitly integrated into the ERP application.",

Nationally, there were 124 million ED visits in 2011, of which the CDC estimates 50% could be handled in a primary care setting. With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care.\nProviding people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.\nPatients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).\nMany clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We've made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations.",

This is enough time for users to meet each other and chat but not too much time in case someone isn't interested or doesn't feel a connection. When the three minutes are up, users are asked if they would like to continue the conversation. If both users say \"yes\", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want. But if someone says \"no\", the connection is closed and both people go their separate ways. No hurt feelings, no need to \"let her down easily\" and no awkward, half-hug on your doorstep.",
